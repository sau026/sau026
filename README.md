I am a Frontend Engineer, highly skilled in user interface development for web applications using, ES6+, HTML5+, and CSS3. I am also good at developing a mobile application as well. As a front-end engineer, I realize the main thing for the Frontend Engineer is original thinking, analyzing new product concepts, handling quality assurance issues, and creating a reusable component.

I am also interested in writing some open-source plugins and published them on NPM.
